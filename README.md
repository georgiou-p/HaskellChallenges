# HaskellChallenges
This coursework involves solving Haskell challenges. It was compeleted as part of my BSc Computer Science, Module: COMP2209-ProgrammingIII, at the University of Southampton 2025. 

The coursework consists of the solutions to the 6 challenges, a test file, and a report on the development and testing strategy for the solutions.
